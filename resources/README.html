        <h2>NOTICE</h2>

        <p>NextFractal depends on thirdparty libraries incuding FreeImage, FFmpeg, ANTLR, Apache Software Foundation, RichTextFX, ControlsFX.</p>

        <p>NextFractal contains code derivated from original code of open source projects Xaos and ContextFree.</p>

        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

        <p>NextFractal is an application for creating fractal images and other algorithmically generated images. Images are generated processing a script and some user provided parameters depending on the selected grammar. The grammar defines the domain specific language used to compose the script.</p>

        <p>NextFractal is currently able to interpret the M language which is designed for creating Mandelbrot and Julia sets, and the CFDG language which is designed for iteratively composing geometric shapes (see <a href="http://www.contextfreeart.org" target="_blank">http://www.contextfreeart.org</a>).</p>

        <p>NextFractal provides also tools for exploring Mandelbrot and Julia sets, creating time based and events based animations, recording animations and rendering images and videos. NextFractal exports with formats PNG, AVI and Quicktime.</p>

        <h2>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h2>

        <p>NextFractal requires Java SDK 8 or later. You can download the latest SDK from Oracle.</p>

        <p>See download page <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads</a></p>

        <div>Java SDK contains the Java compiler which is required to optimise images rendering process.
        NextFractal detects the compiler and use it to compile code in memory and reduce the rendering time.</div>

        <h2>USER GUIDE</h2>

        <p>Please read grammars documentation and tutorials on <a href="http://nextbreakpoint.com/nextfractal" target="_blank">http://nextbreakpoint.com/nextfractal</a>.</p>

        <p>NextFractal accepts a few of keyboard commands when focus is on main image:</p>

        <pre>Use keys 1,2,3,4,5 to change zoom speed

Use key T to show/hide traps

Use key O to show/hide orbit

Use key P to show/hide previews</pre>

        <h2>BUILD INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

        <p>You can build NextFractal from the source code. Checkout or download the source code from GitHub and run the build script. The build script requires Apache Ant and Apache Maven. By default the script will create a distribution for all platforms. Run script with target to build the distribution for a specific platform only. Apple command-line development tools are required to build MacOS distribution.</p>

        <p>Get the code from <a href="https://github.com/nextbreakpoint/nextfractal" target="_blank">https://github.com/nextbreakpoint/nextfractal</a>:</p>

        <pre>git checkout https://github.com/nextbreakpoint/nextfractal.git</pre>

        <p>Use default target to build the distribution for all platforms:</p>

        <pre>ant</pre>

        <p>Use target build-linux to build Linux distribution:</p>

        <pre>ant build-linux</pre>

        <p>Use target build-macos to build MacOS distribution:</p>

        <pre>ant build-macos</pre>

        <p>Use target build-win32 to build Windows distribution:</p>

        <pre>ant build-win32</pre>
